## General info
Outlook emails are rendered using Microsoft Word so they rely on every developers favorite thing: tables! Not sure what tags will work? I highly recommend <a href="https://www.caniemail.com/">CanIEmail</a> Just be prepared because there is quite a lot that you can't use, hence the need for tables. There are all kinds of weird rules you have to follow when developing HTML emails for Outlook. 


## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS



## Status
Project is: 
In Progress. 
I'll be adding more layouts in the coming weeks (ie three column, four column, layouts with videos, etc). Please feel free to fork and make them your own. I'll be adding a boilerplate to get you started soon! Best of luck with Outlook. May the odds be ever in your favor.
