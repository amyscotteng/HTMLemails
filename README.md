## General info
Outlook emails are rendered using Microsoft Word so they rely on every developers favorite thing: tables! Not sure what tags will work? I highly recommend <a href="https://www.caniemail.com/">CanIEmail</a> Just be prepared because there is quite a lot that you can't use, hence the need for tables. Hey. At least we can still use internal CSS!
There are all kinds of weird rules you have to follow when developing HTML emails for Outlook. The CSS rule background-color does not exist according to Outlook! It's just one of many and I do mean MANY rules.


## Technologies
* HTML4
* CSS2
(You have not time traveled, I swear.)


## Status
Project is: 
In Progress. 
I'll be adding more designs in the coming weeks (ie three column, four column, etc). Please feel free to fork and make them your own.
