# HTMLemails
 A collection of HTML emails designed to work in Outlook. Outlook emails are rendered using Microsoft Word so they rely on every developers favorite thing: tables!
 Not sure what tags will work? I highly recommend caniemail.com . Just be prepared because there is quite a lot that you can't use, hence the need for tables. Hey. At least
 we can still use internal CSS!
